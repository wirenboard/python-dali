    Implements a Barrier primitive.
    Useful for synchronizing a fixed number of tasks at known synchronization

    have all made their call.

    There is timeout too. If timeout is reached, the barrier is released and
    all waiting tasks are simultaneously awoken.

    This implementation also allows passing payloads to wait calls. When the
    barrier is released, all payloads are sent to all tasks that were
    waiting on the barrier alongside with their index in the barrier.
    It allows one of the simultaneously awoken tasks to perform some work
    on behalf of all tasks that were waiting on the barrier.
